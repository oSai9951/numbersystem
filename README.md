*** Created a Index.js file ***
1- numbersystem was cloned from the github
   before creating index.js
2- The code was simple written to find even or odd from the numbers array
`const numbers =  [
    3, 7, 2, 15, 9, 20, 5, 14, 12, 1, 8, 11, 6, 19, 4, 10, 17, 13, 16, 18,
  ];`

3- Expected output is =
        3 is an odd number.
        7 is an odd number.

  - And I have to find prime number , then add all the prime number in the primeArray which was created by pushing all the prime numbers created with numbers array .
